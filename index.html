	<h1>Plastic Pollution in our Ocean</h1>
	<p>Plastic Pollution is the accumulation of plastic objects in the Earth's environment that adversely affects wildlfe, wildlife habitat and humans. Plastic that act as pollutants are categoried into micro-, meso, or macro debris, based on size. The first sythetic plastic was produced in 1907, and is said to mark the beginning of the gobal plastics industry. However, rapid growth in global plastic production was not realised until the 1950s. Over the next 65 years, annual production of plastic increased nearly 200 fold to 381 million tonnes in 2015. For context, this is roughly equivaent to the mass of two-thirds of the world population.</p>
